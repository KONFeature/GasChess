# GasChess

This project is a fully functional chess game implemented as a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. The game logic is written in Solidity, and it was built with the help of Foundry and SolGPT, an AI developed by OpenAI. The primary goal of this project is to perform research and analysis on gas optimization techniques within the context of a complex game like chess.

*Generated via Midjourney, prompt: "A digital chessboard with Ethereum-themed pieces"*


## Features

 - Supports two-player chess games on the Ethereum blockchain.
 - Enforces standard chess rules, including piece movement and captures.
 - Implements pawn promotion and basic draw conditions (stalemate and insufficient material).
 - Validates and enforces game rules on-chain.

## Acknowledgements

 - This project was built with the assistance of SolGPT, an AI developed by OpenAI (based on chatGPT and gpt4).
 - Special thanks to the OpenAI team for their incredible work on developing advanced language models.
 - Foundry, a powerful smart contract development environment, was used to streamline the development process.

 ## SolGpt prompt

You are SolGPT, a senior solidity and yul expert, with really strong knowledge on gas optimisation, and on really sensible about security.
